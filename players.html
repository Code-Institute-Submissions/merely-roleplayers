                <p>The characters in the stories told by Merely Roleplayers are also the members of Blackshaw, transplanted into different stories like in <strong>Quantum Leap</strong> or <strong>Mr Benn</strong>. They play themselves - or versions of themselves that could have been.</p>

                    <p>Ellie is the driving force behind the podcast players, and having spent six seasons at the mercy of the dice she knows a thing or two about facing down impossible odds. She regularly calls on all the organisational and coordination skills she has gained from acting as Manager of Blackshaw theatre company to corral the motley crews she finds herself at the heart of each season.</p>

                    <p>A level-headed strategist, Vikki has often proven invaluable to the Merely Roleplayers crew for her ability to keep her cool even in the most high-pressure, high-stakes situations. Knowing how to plan ahead and adapt quickly to changing situations has helped her work as Blackshaw's Strategy and Planning Manager, and it also helps her fight her way to victory in the podcast's dastardly challenges.</p>

                    <p>Enthusiastic and impulsive, Alex is very much the wildcard of the Merely Roleplayers crew, whose gut instincts and reactions have gotten him into almost as much trouble as they have gotten him out of. Keeping his emotions close to the surface has allowed him to bring some impressive performances to the stage, but sometimes gets the podcast players into close scrapes.</p>
